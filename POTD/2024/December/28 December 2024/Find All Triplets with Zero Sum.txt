Find All Triplets with Zero Sum

Given an array arr[], find all possible triplets i, j, k in the arr[] whose sum of elements is equals to zero. 
Returned triplet should also be internally sorted i.e. i<j<k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1]
Output: [[0, 1, 4], [2, 3, 4]]
Explanation: Triplets with sum 0 are:
arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[4] = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0
arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] = 2 + (-3) + 1 = 0
