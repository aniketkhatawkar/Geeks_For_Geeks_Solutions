Set Matrix Zeroes

You are given a 2D matrix mat[][] of size n√óm. The task is to modify the matrix such that if mat[i][j] is 0, all the elements in the i-th row and j-th column are set to 0 and do it in constant space complexity.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, -1, 1],
                [-1, 0, 1],
                [1, -1, 1]]
Output: [[1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 1]]
Explanation: mat[1][1] = 0, so all elements in row 1 and column 1 are updated to zeroes.
