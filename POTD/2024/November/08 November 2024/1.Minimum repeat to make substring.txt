Minimum repeat to make substring

Given two strings s1 and s2. Return a minimum number of times s1 has to be repeated such that s2 is a substring of it. If s2 can never be a substring then return -1.

Note: Both the strings contain only lowercase letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "ww", s2 = "www"
Output: 2
Explanation: Repeating s1 two times (wwww), s2 is a substring of it.
