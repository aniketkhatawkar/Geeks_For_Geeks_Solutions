Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists

Given two singly linked lists, return the point where two linked lists intersect.

Note: If the linked lists do not merge at any point, return -1.

Examples:

Input: Linked list 1: 4->4->4->4->4, Linked list 2: 4->4->4
 
Output: 4
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 4->4 whose starting point is 4.
