Count distinct elements in every window

Given an integer array arr[] and a number k. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size k in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4
Output:  [3, 4, 4, 3]
Explanation: Window 1 of size k = 4 is 1 2 1 3. Number of distinct elements in this window are 3. 
Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4. Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2. Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. Number of distinct elements in this window are 3.
