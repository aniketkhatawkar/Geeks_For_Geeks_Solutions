Count Subarrays with given XOR

Given an array of integers arr[] and a number k, count the number of subarrays having XOR of their elements as k.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 6 are [4, 2], [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], [2, 2, 6], and [6]. Hence, the answer is 4.
