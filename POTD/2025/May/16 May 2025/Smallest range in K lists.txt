Smallest range in K lists

Given a 2d integer array arr[][] of size k*n, where each row is sorted in ascending order. Your task is to find the smallest range [l, r] that includes at least one element from each of the k lists. If more than one such ranges are found, return the first one.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, k = 3, arr[][] = [[4, 7, 9, 12, 15], [0, 8, 10, 14, 20], [6, 12, 16, 30, 50]]
Output: [6, 8]
Explanation: Smallest range is formed by  number 7 from the first list, 8 from second list and 6 from the third list.
