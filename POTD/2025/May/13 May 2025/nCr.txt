nCr

Given two integer values n and r, the task is to find the value of Binomial Coefficient nCr

A binomial coefficient nCr can be defined as the coefficient of xr in the expansion of (1 + x)n that gives the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects without considering the order.
The binomial coefficient nCr is calculated as : C(n,r) = n! / r! * (n-r) !
Note: If r is greater than n, return 0.
It is guaranteed that the value of nCr will fit within a 32-bit integer.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, r = 2
Output: 10
Explaination: The value of 5C2 is calculated as 5!/(5âˆ’2)!*2! = 5!/3!*2! = 10.
