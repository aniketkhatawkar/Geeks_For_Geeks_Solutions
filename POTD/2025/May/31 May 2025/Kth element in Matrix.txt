Kth element in Matrix

Given a matrix mat[][] of size n*n, where each row and column is sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Examples:
Input: n = 4, mat[][] = [[16, 28, 60, 64], [22, 41, 63, 91], [27, 50, 87, 93], [36, 78, 87, 94]], k = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: 27 is the 3rd smallest element.
