Burning Tree

Given a binary tree and a target node, determine the minimum time required to burn the entire tree if the target node is set on fire. In one second, the fire spreads from a node to its left child, right child, and parent.
Note: The tree contains unique values.

Examples : 

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], target = 2
  
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially 2 is set to fire at 0 sec 
At 1 sec: Nodes 4, 5, 1 catches fire.
At 2 sec: Node 3 catches fire.
At 3 sec: Nodes 6, 7 catches fire.
It takes 3s to burn the complete tree.
