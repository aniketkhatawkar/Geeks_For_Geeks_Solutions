Find rectangle with corners as 1

Given an n x m binary matrix mat[][] containing only 0s and 1s, determine if there exists a rectangle within the matrix such that all four corners of the rectangle are 1. If such a rectangle exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:

Input: mat[][] =
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]] 
Output: true
Explanation: Valid corners are at index (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4)
