Predecessor and Successor

You are given root node of the BST and an integer key. You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of the given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.

Note:- In an inorder traversal the number just smaller than the target is the predecessor and the number just greater than the target is the successor. 

Examples :

Input: root[] = [8, 1, 9, N, 4, N, 10, 3, N, N, N], key = 8

Output: 4 9
Explanation: In the given BST the inorder predecessor of 8 is 4 and inorder successor of 8 is 9.
