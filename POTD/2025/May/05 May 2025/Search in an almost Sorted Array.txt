Given a sorted integer array arr[] consisting of distinct elements, where some elements of the array are moved to either of the adjacent positions, i.e. arr[i] may be present at arr[i-1] or arr[i+1].
Given an integer target.  You have to return the index ( 0-based ) of the target in the array. If target is not present return -1.

Examples:
