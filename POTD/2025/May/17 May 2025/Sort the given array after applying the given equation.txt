Sort the given array after applying the given equation

Given an integer array arr[] sorted in ascending order, along with three integers: A, B, and C. The task is to transform each element x in the array using the quadratic function A*(x2) + B*x + C. After applying this transformation to every element, return the modified array in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4], A = 1, B = 3, C = 5
Output: [3, 5, 9, 15, 33]
Explanation: After applying f(x) = 1*(x2)+ 3*x + 5 to each x, we get [9, 3, 5, 15, 33]. After sorting this array, the array becomes [3, 5, 9, 15, 33].
