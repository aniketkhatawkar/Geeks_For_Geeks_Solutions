Smallest Divisor

Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k (where k â‰¥ arr.length), find the smallest positive integer divisor such that the sum of the ceiling values of each element in arr[] divided by this divisor is less than or equal to k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 5, 9], k = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest divisor having sum of quotients (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5) less than or equal to 6.
