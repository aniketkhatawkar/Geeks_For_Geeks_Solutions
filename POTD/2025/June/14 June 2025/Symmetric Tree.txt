Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is symmetric, i.e., whether the tree is a mirror image of itself.


A binary tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
   ex-1_1
Output: True
Explanation: As the left and right half of the above tree is mirror image, tree is symmetric.
