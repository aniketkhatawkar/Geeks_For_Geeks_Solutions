Count the paths

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V nodes labeled from 0 to V-1, and a list of directed edges, count the total number of distinct paths from a given start node to a destination node. Each edge is represented as edges[i] = [u, v], indicating a directed edge from u to v.

Examples :

Input: edges[][] = [[0,1], [0,3], [2,0], [2,1], [1,3]], V = 4, src = 2, dest = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to reach at 3 from 2. These are: 2 -> 1 -> 3, 2 -> 0 -> 3 and 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 3.
