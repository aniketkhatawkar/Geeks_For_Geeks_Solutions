Group Balls by Sequence

You are given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each element arr[i] represents the number written on the i-th ball, and a positive integer k.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:


Each group contains exactly k balls.
The numbers in each group are consecutive integers
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 1, 2, 11], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The hand can be rearranged as [1, 2], [10, 11]. There are two groups of size 2. Each group has 2 consecutive cards.
