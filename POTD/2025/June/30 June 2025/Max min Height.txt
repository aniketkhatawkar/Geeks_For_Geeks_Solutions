Max min Height

Given a garden with n flowers planted in a row, that is represented by an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the height of the ith flower.You will water them for k days. In one day you can water w continuous flowers. Whenever you water a flower its height increases by 1 unit. You have to maximize the minimum height of all flowers after  k days of watering.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], k = 2, w = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum height after watering is 2.
Day 1: Water the last two flowers -> arr becomes [2, 3, 4, 6, 2]
Day 2: Water the last two flowers -> arr becomes [2, 3, 4, 7, 3]
