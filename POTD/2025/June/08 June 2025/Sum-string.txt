Sum-string

Given a string s consisting of digits, determine whether it can be classified as a sum-string.

A sum-string is a string that can be split into more than two non-empty substrings such that:


The rightmost substring is equal to the sum of the two substrings immediately before it (interpreted as integers).

This condition must apply recursively to the substrings before it.

The rightmost substring (and any number in the sum) must not contain leading zeroes, unless the number is exactly '0'.

Examples:

Input: s = "12243660"
Output: true
Explanation: The string can be split as {"12", "24", "36", "60"} where each number is the sum of the two before it:
36 = 12 + 24, and 60 = 24 + 36. Hence, it is a sum-string.
