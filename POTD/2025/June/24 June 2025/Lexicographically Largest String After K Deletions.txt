Lexicographically Largest String After K Deletions

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k, your task is to remove exactly k characters from the string. The resulting string must be the largest possible in lexicographical  order, while maintain the relative order of the remaining characters.

Examples:
Input: s = "ritz", k = 2
Output: tz 
Explaination: By removing two characters in all possible ways, we get: "ri", "rt", "rz", "it", "iz", and "tz". Among these, "tz" is lexicographically largest string.
