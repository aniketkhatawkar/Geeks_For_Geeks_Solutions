All Palindromic Partitions

Given a string s, find all possible ways to partition it such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome.

Examples:

Input: s = "geeks"
Output: [[g, e, e, k, s], [g, ee, k, s]]
Explanation: [g, e, e, k, s] and [g, ee, k, s] are the only partitions of "geeks" where each substring is a palindrome.
