K closest elements

You are given a sorted array arr[] of unique integers, an integer k, and a target value x. Return exactly k elements from the array closest to x, excluding x if it exists.

An element a is closer to x than b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or

|a - x| == |b - x| and a > b (i.e., prefer the larger element if tied)


Return the k closest elements in order of closeness.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 10, 12], k = 2, x = 4
Output: 3 1
Explanation: 4 is excluded, Closest elements to 4 are: 3 (1), 1 (3). So, the 2 closest elements are: 3 1
