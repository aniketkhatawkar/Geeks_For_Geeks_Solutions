Largest Divisible Subset

Given an array arr[] of distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the largest subset such that for every pair of elements (x, y) in the subset, either x divides y or y divides x.
Note : If multiple subsets of the same maximum length exist, return the one that is lexicographically greatest, after sorting the subset in ascending order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 16, 7, 8, 4]
Output: [1, 4, 8, 16]
Explanation: The largest divisible subset is [1, 4, 8, 16], where each element divides the next one. This subset is already the lexicographically greatest one.
