Split Array Largest Sum

Given an array arr[] and an integer k, divide the array into k contiguous subarrays such that the maximum sum among these subarrays is minimized. Find this minimum possible maximum sum.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 3
Output: 4
Exaplanation: Optimal Split is [1, 2], [3], [4]. Maximum sum of all subarrays is 4, which is minimum possible for 3 splits.
