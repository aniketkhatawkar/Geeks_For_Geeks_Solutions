Search Pattern (Rabin-Karp Algorithm)

Given two strings:

A text string in which you want to search.

A pattern string that you are looking for within the text.

Return all positions (1-based indexing) where the pattern occurs as a substring in the text. If the pattern does not occur, return an empty list.

All characters in both strings are lowercase English letters (a to z).

Examples:

Input: text = "birthdayboy", pattern = "birth"
Output: [1]
Explanation: The string "birth" occurs at index 1 in text.
