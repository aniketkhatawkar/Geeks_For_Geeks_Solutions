Subarrays With At Most K Distinct Integers

You are given an array arr[] of positive integers and an integer k, find the number of subarrays in arr[] where the count of distinct integers is at most k.

Note: A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Subarrays with at most 2 distinct elements are: [1], [2], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 3].
