Next element with greater frequency

Given an array arr[] of integers, for each element, find the closest (distance wise) to its right that has a higher frequency than the current element.
If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, -1, -1, 2, 1, -1]
Explanation: Frequencies: 1 → 3 times, 2 → 2 times, 3 → 1 time.
For arr[0] = 2, the next element 1 has a higher frequency → 1.
For arr[1] and arr[2], no element to the right has a higher frequency → -1.
For arr[3] = 3, the next element 2 has a higher frequency → 2.
For arr[4] = 2, the next element 1 has a higher frequency → 1.
For arr[5] = 1, no elements to the right → -1.
