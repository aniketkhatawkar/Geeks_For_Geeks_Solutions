Longest subarray with Atmost two distinct integers

Given an array arr[] consisting of positive integers, your task is to find the length of the longest subarray that contains at most two distinct integers.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The entire array [2, 1, 2] contains at most two distinct integers (2 and 1). Hence, the length of the longest subarray is 3.
