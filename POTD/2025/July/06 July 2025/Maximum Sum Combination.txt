Maximum Sum Combination

You are given two integer arrays a[] and b[] of equal size. A sum combination is formed by adding one element from a[] and one from b[], using each index pair (i, j) at most once. Return the top k maximum sum combinations, sorted in non-increasing order.

Examples:

Input: a[] = [3, 2], b[] = [1, 4], k = 2
Output: [7, 6]
Explanation: Possible sums: 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 4 = 7, 2 + 1 = 3, 2 + 4 = 6, Top 2 sums are 7 and 6.
