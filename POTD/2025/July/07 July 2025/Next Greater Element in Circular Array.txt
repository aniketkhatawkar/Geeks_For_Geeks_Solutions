Next Greater Element in Circular Array

Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Circular Property:

Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation:
The next greater element for 1 is 3.
The next greater element for 3 is 4.
The next greater element for 2 is 4.
The next greater element for 4 does not exist, so return -1.
