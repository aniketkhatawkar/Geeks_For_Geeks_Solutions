Maximize partitions in a String

Given a string s of lowercase English alphabets, your task is to return the maximum number of substrings formed, after possible partitions (probably zero) of s such that no two substrings have a common character.

Examples:

Input: s = "acbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: "a" and "cbbcc" are two substrings that do not share any characters between them.
