Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given an array arr[], determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Note: Each element must be in exactly one subset.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The two parts are [1, 5, 5] and [11].
