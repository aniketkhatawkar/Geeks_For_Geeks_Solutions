Implement Trie

Implement Trie class and complete insert(), search() and isPrefix() function for the following queries :

Type 1 : (1, word), calls insert(word) function and insert word in the Trie
Type 2 : (2, word), calls search(word) function and check whether word exists in Trie or not.
Type 3 : (3, word), calls isPrefix(word) function and check whether word exists as a prefix of any string in Trie or not.
Examples :

Input: query[][] = [[1, "abcd"], [1, "abc"], [1, "bcd"], [2, "bc"], [3, "bc"], [2, "abc"]]
Output: [false, true, true]
Explanation: string "bc" does not exist in the trie, "bc" exists as prefix of the word "bcd" in the trie, and "abc" also exists in the trie.
