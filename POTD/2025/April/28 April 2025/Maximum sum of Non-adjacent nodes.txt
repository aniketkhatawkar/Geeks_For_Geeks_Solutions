Maximum sum of Non-adjacent nodes

Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node. Your task is to select a subset of nodes such that the sum of their values is maximized, with the condition that no two selected nodes are directly connected that is, if a node is included in the subset, neither its parent nor its children can be included.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [11, 1, 2]

Output: 11
Explanation: The maximum sum is obtained by selecting the node 11.
