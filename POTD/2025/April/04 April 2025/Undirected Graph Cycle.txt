Undirected Graph Cycle

Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, represented as a 2D vector edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes an edge between vertices u and v, determine whether the graph contains a cycle or not.

Examples:

Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
 
1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 is a cycle.
