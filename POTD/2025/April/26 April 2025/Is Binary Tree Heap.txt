Is Binary Tree Heap

You are given a binary tree, and the task is to determine whether it satisfies the properties of a max-heap.

A binary tree is considered a max-heap if it satisfies the following conditions:

Completeness: Every level of the tree, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Max-Heap Property: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
Examples:

Input: root[] = [97, 46, 37, 12, 3, 7, 31, 6, 9]
 
Output: true
Explanation: The tree is complete and satisfies the max-heap property.
