Find length of Loop

Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: 'c' is the position of the node which is the next pointer of the last node of the linkedlist. If c is 0, then there is no loop.

Examples:

Input: head: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, c = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4.
